# Lab Notebook for PSP in KENDA Analysis

## August 25

### Next Steps from meeting
- Separate analysis by period: strong and weak forcing. 
- Additional metrics
    - Precipitation histograms
    - SAL
    - CRPS

### Preload precipitation files
Preload precipitation files to make analysis a lot faster. 
Preloading done in ipynb, currently running for forecasts, det and ens.
Tomorrow I need to adjust the precipitation forecast analysis script to read the preloaded files. 

## August 26
Task: Adjust verif_fc_prec.py for preloaded files! Add metrics
 to dictionary instead of list! Done
Next: Add precipitation histograms. Need the plotting still!
